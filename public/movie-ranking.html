<h1>The Best Movies According to TharTeen</h1>
<h2>Top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1. The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>
	It is no wonder that the film has such a high rating, it is quite literally breathtaking. What can I say that hasn't said before? Not much, it's the story, the acting, the premise, but most of all,
	this movie is about how it makes you feel. Sometimes you watch a film, and can't remember it days later, this film loves with you, once you've seen it, you don't forget.
</p>

<p>The ultimate story of friendship, of hope, and of life, and overcoming adversity.</p>

<p>
	I understand why so many class this as the best film of all time, it isn't mine, but I get it. If you haven't seen it, or haven't seen it for some time, you need to watch it, it's amazing. 10/10.
</p>

<h3>2. The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>
	This movie is a work of art. The finest sequel ever made. I don't think we will see another movie like this for a long time. Heath Ledger's Joker is the best movie charachter I have ever seen by
	far.
</p>
<p>
	Avengers Endgame is great, but The Dark Knight is much better. The best Batman ever! The best Joker ever! The best DC movie ever! The best superhero movie ever! Ando for me, the best movie ever!
</p>

<h3>3. Your Name</h3>
<p>
	Your Name is just a good movie. This movie felt long, but not too long. All the way through, I was asking what would happen next. It was clever, emotional, and left me crying after the movie. The
	twist was done really well, and I almost wanted to pause the movie.
</p>
<p>
	Also, the animation is gorgeous. You get to see detailed images from many angles and perspectives, and there were hundreds of animators! The credits didn't start out with the cast like it usually
	would. The first thing you saw after a black screen was hundreds of names of animators and designers.
</p>
<p>
	I watched this movie again and I still felt my muscles ready to let tears out. I would not recommend this movie any less than the next guy, so what are you waiting for? Get a couple of friends and
	watch Your Name!
